        <h4>Musk shocks everyone once again!</h4>
        <p><br> Today it was officially announced that Elon Musk, previous founder of PayPal and current founder of SpaceX acquired Twitter for a reported price of $120 billion. He also began taking initiative over some of Twitter's workers, firing at least four top Twitter executives including the COO and CMO. <br> <br> Musk  has stated that he wished to allow more free speech. As a Republican, he aims to make the party more outgoing on Twitter, limiting the amount of tweets for opposing parties in order to balance out voter engagement. This would mean that former President Donald Trump would gain access to his previously banned Twitter account, while current President Joe Biden would be limited to 50 tweets a day. <br> <br> <img class="tweet" src="../game/assets/images/ElonTweet.PNG" alt="Elon Musk's tweet which describes his plan to additionally purchase Snapchat and Facebook">
        <p class="caption">Tweet made by Elon Musk on his plans for Twitter's future</p> <br> <p>However, these are not the only changes to be made. Musk also aims, as part of his vision, to claim Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat all under his company Z-Corp, by at least 2025. Currently, he has claimed that Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, is analyzing a rough $100 billion deal for ownership transfer of the platform. A response is to be expected in the next 2-3 months.</p>
